# mp3renamer

This was a project I started back in the 2004-05 timeframe when I was a developer at National Instruments working on the LabWindows CVI team. It was originally intended to just rename mp3s so that I didn't have to do it manually, and was a quick and dirty application I banged out over a weekend. As new features were added it quickly spiraled out of control, and became a convenient testing project for the CVI team (many a bug was uncovered and fixed because of it). The ability to read/tag files was added, then artwork downloads, then metadata retrieval from musicbrainz, then fanart downloads, APE support, etc. [id3lib](https://sourceforge.net/projects/id3lib/files/) was the tagging library I used for years, but it was terrible and unmodified since 2003, and I finally switched to a modified version of [taglib](https://taglib.github.io/) back in early 2016.

This project is written in [LabWindows CVI](http://www.ni.com/lwcvi/), an ANSI C development environment. This means that A) It's probably not of much interest to anyone, and B) the code is *really* ugly. It should have been refactored and rewritten years ago, but I just never had the time/interest to do so. It should not be taken as indicative of my work.

It was stored in many different SCC sites over the years and finally came to rest here at github after all the other ones folded or lost popularity.
